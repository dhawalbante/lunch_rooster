# TODO for Fixing 404 on /api/chat/messages in Chat.js

- [ ] Update frontend/src/pages/Chat.js API calls:
  - Replace full URLs with relative URL paths in api.get and api.post calls.
- [ ] Test frontend chat functionality and ensure messages load and send without 404.
- [ ] Verify Authorization header is sent with API requests.
